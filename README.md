## llama2.c

Forked from Karparthy/llama.c and did some changes

## unsorted todos

- add support in run.c of reading version 1+ files from export, later deprecate "version 0"
- run.cu (CUDA) investigate and merge
- add more tests inside [test.c](test.c)
- add Engine class for use in sample.py that does efficient inference in PyTorch, e.g. KV cache keeping
- make it easier to add a new dataset with not too much pain
